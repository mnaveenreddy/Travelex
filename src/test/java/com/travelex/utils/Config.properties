#what I could have done better#

1) I have used absolute paths for few locators which is not recommended but i couldn't find any other choise in the given time
2) I have "hard coded" "Date picker" which is highly rejectable but i have no choice in the given time, if i would have known the 
   requirements about the calender i would have done better
3) And I have covered select a store test case in the first test case where i selected a store , I done this because of time frame. 
    I spent this time to write few generic methods (reusable methods) which is needed for framework.
